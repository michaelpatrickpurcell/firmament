{\setmainfont[Scale=0.95]{Century Gothic-Bold}\LARGE Placement Rules}\\[1.0ex]

\setmainfont{Tex Gyre Schola}
When you claim a square, you must adhere to the following three placement rules:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
	\item You may only claim a square that matches your color.
	\item You may not claim a square that is orthogonally adjacent to another claimed square.
	\item You may not claim a square that is diagonally adjacent to two other claimed squares that lie on the same diagonal.
\end{enumerate}
You win the game if you claim any square and all four of the squares that are diagonally adjacent to that square.\\[3ex]
